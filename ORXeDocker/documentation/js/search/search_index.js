Design\nstyling and ink ripples.\n\n\nNative  and  elements are always used in order to provide the most straightforward\nand accessible experience for users. A  element should be used whenever some action\nis performed. An  element should be used whenever the user will navigate to another view.\nThere are several button variants, each applied as an attribute:\n\n\n\nAttribute\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nmat-button\nRectangular text button w/ no elevation\n\n\nmat-raised-button\nRectangular contained button w/ elevation\n\n\nmat-flat-button\nRectangular contained button w/ no elevation\n\n\nmat-stroked-button\nRectangular outlined button w/ no elevation\n\n\nmat-icon-button\nCircular button with a transparent background, meant to contain an icon\n\n\nmat-fab\nCircular button w/ elevation, defaults to theme's accent color\n\n\nmat-mini-fab\nSame as mat-fab but smaller\n\n\n\nTheming\nButtons can be colored in terms of the current theme using the color property to set the\nbackground color to primary, accent, or warn.\nCapitalization\nAccording to the Material design spec button text has to be capitalized, however we have opted not\nto capitalize buttons automatically via text-transform: uppercase, because it can cause issues in\ncertain locales. It is also worth noting that using ALL CAPS in the text itself causes issues for\nscreen-readers, which will read the text character-by-character. We leave the decision of how to\napproach this to the consuming app.\nAccessibility\nAngular Material uses native  and  elements to ensure an accessible experience by\ndefault. The  element should be used for any interaction that performs an action on the\ncurrent page. The  element should be used for any interaction that navigates to another\nview.\nButtons or links containing only icons (such as mat-fab, mat-mini-fab, and mat-icon-button)\nshould be given a meaningful label via aria-label or aria-labelledby.\n\n    \n\n    \n        import {FocusMonitor} from '@angular/cdk/a11y';\nimport {Platform} from '@angular/cdk/platform';\nimport {\n  ChangeDetectionStrategy,\n  Component,\n  ElementRef,\n  OnDestroy,\n  ViewChild,\n  ViewEncapsulation,\n  Optional,\n  Inject,\n  Input,\n} from '@angular/core';\nimport {\n  CanColor,\n  CanDisable,\n  CanDisableRipple,\n  CanColorCtor,\n  CanDisableCtor,\n  CanDisableRippleCtor,\n  MatRipple,\n  mixinColor,\n  mixinDisabled,\n  mixinDisableRipple,\n} from '@angular/material/core';\nimport {ANIMATION_MODULE_TYPE} from '@angular/platform-browser/animations';\n\n/** Default color palette for round buttons (mat-fab and mat-mini-fab) */\nconst DEFAULT_ROUND_BUTTON_COLOR = 'accent';\n\n/**\n * List of classes to add to MatButton instances based on host attributes to\n * style as different variants.\n */\nconst BUTTON_HOST_ATTRIBUTES = [\n  'mat-button',\n  'mat-flat-button',\n  'mat-icon-button',\n  'mat-raised-button',\n  'mat-stroked-button',\n  'mat-mini-fab',\n  'mat-fab',\n];\n\n// Boilerplate for applying mixins to MatButton.\n/** @docs-private */\nexport class MatButtonBase {\n  constructor(public _elementRef: ElementRef) {}\n}\n\nexport const _MatButtonMixinBase:\n    CanDisableRippleCtor & CanDisableCtor & CanColorCtor & typeof MatButtonBase =\n        mixinColor(mixinDisabled(mixinDisableRipple(MatButtonBase)));\n\n/**\n * Material design button.\n */\n@Component({\n  moduleId: module.id,\n  selector: `button[mat-button], button[mat-raised-button], button[mat-icon-button],\n             button[mat-fab], button[mat-mini-fab], button[mat-stroked-button],\n             button[mat-flat-button]`,\n  exportAs: 'matButton',\n  host: {\n    '[disabled]': 'disabled || null',\n    '[class._mat-animation-noopable]': '_animationMode === \"NoopAnimations\"',\n  },\n  templateUrl: 'button.html',\n  styleUrls: ['button.scss'],\n  inputs: ['disabled', 'disableRipple', 'color'],\n  encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None,\n  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush,\n})\nexport class MatButton extends _MatButtonMixinBase\n    implements OnDestroy, CanDisable, CanColor, CanDisableRipple {\n\n  /** Whether the button is round. */\n  readonly isRoundButton: boolean = this._hasHostAttributes('mat-fab', 'mat-mini-fab');\n\n  /** Whether the button is icon button. */\n  readonly isIconButton: boolean = this._hasHostAttributes('mat-icon-button');\n\n  /** Reference to the MatRipple instance of the button. */\n  @ViewChild(MatRipple) ripple: MatRipple;\n\n  constructor(elementRef: ElementRef,\n              /**\n               * @deprecated Platform checks for SSR are no longer needed\n               * @breaking-change 8.0.0\n               */\n              _platform: Platform,\n              private _focusMonitor: FocusMonitor,\n              // @breaking-change 8.0.0 `_animationMode` parameter to be made required.\n              @Optional() @Inject(ANIMATION_MODULE_TYPE) public _animationMode?: string) {\n    super(elementRef);\n\n    // For each of the variant selectors that is prevent in the button's host\n    // attributes, add the correct corresponding class.\n    for (const attr of BUTTON_HOST_ATTRIBUTES) {\n      if (this._hasHostAttributes(attr)) {\n        (elementRef.nativeElement as HTMLElement).classList.add(attr);\n      }\n    }\n\n    this._focusMonitor.monitor(this._elementRef, true);\n\n    if (this.isRoundButton) {\n      this.color = DEFAULT_ROUND_BUTTON_COLOR;\n    }\n  }\n\n  ngOnDestroy() {\n    this._focusMonitor.stopMonitoring(this._elementRef);\n  }\n\n  /** Focuses the button. */\n  focus(): void {\n    this._getHostElement().focus();\n  }\n\n  _getHostElement() {\n    return this._elementRef.nativeElement;\n  }\n\n  _isRippleDisabled() {\n    return this.disableRipple || this.disabled;\n  }\n\n  /** Gets whether the button has one of the given attributes. */\n  _hasHostAttributes(...attributes: string[]) {\n    return attributes.some(attribute => this._getHostElement().hasAttribute(attribute));\n  }\n}\n\n/**\n * Raised Material design button.\n */\n@Component({\n  moduleId: module.id,\n  selector: `a[mat-button], a[mat-raised-button], a[mat-icon-button], a[mat-fab],\n             a[mat-mini-fab], a[mat-stroked-button], a[mat-flat-button]`,\n  exportAs: 'matButton, matAnchor',\n  host: {\n    // Note that we ignore the user-specified tabindex when it's disabled for\n    // consistency with the `mat-button` applied on native buttons where even\n    // though they have an index, they're not tabbable.\n    '[attr.tabindex]': 'disabled ?

Design\nstyling and ink ripples.\n\n\nNative  and  elements are always used in order to provide the most straightforward\nand accessible experience for users. A  element should be used whenever some action\nis performed. An  element should be used whenever the user will navigate to another view.\nThere are several button variants, each applied as an attribute:\n\n\n\nAttribute\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nmat-button\nRectangular text button w/ no elevation\n\n\nmat-raised-button\nRectangular contained button w/ elevation\n\n\nmat-flat-button\nRectangular contained button w/ no elevation\n\n\nmat-stroked-button\nRectangular outlined button w/ no elevation\n\n\nmat-icon-button\nCircular button with a transparent background, meant to contain an icon\n\n\nmat-fab\nCircular button w/ elevation, defaults to theme's accent color\n\n\nmat-mini-fab\nSame as mat-fab but smaller\n\n\n\nTheming\nButtons can be colored in terms of the current theme using the color property to set the\nbackground color to primary, accent, or warn.\nCapitalization\nAccording to the Material design spec button text has to be capitalized, however we have opted not\nto capitalize buttons automatically via text-transform: uppercase, because it can cause issues in\ncertain locales. It is also worth noting that using ALL CAPS in the text itself causes issues for\nscreen-readers, which will read the text character-by-character. We leave the decision of how to\napproach this to the consuming app.\nAccessibility\nAngular Material uses native  and  elements to ensure an accessible experience by\ndefault. The  element should be used for any interaction that performs an action on the\ncurrent page. The  element should be used for any interaction that navigates to another\nview.\nButtons or links containing only icons (such as mat-fab, mat-mini-fab, and mat-icon-button)\nshould be given a meaningful label via aria-label or aria-labelledby.\n\n    \n\n    \n        import {FocusMonitor} from '@angular/cdk/a11y';\nimport {Platform} from '@angular/cdk/platform';\nimport {\n  ChangeDetectionStrategy,\n  Component,\n  ElementRef,\n  OnDestroy,\n  ViewChild,\n  ViewEncapsulation,\n  Optional,\n  Inject,\n  Input,\n} from '@angular/core';\nimport {\n  CanColor,\n  CanDisable,\n  CanDisableRipple,\n  CanColorCtor,\n  CanDisableCtor,\n  CanDisableRippleCtor,\n  MatRipple,\n  mixinColor,\n  mixinDisabled,\n  mixinDisableRipple,\n} from '@angular/material/core';\nimport {ANIMATION_MODULE_TYPE} from '@angular/platform-browser/animations';\n\n/** Default color palette for round buttons (mat-fab and mat-mini-fab) */\nconst DEFAULT_ROUND_BUTTON_COLOR = 'accent';\n\n/**\n * List of classes to add to MatButton instances based on host attributes to\n * style as different variants.\n */\nconst BUTTON_HOST_ATTRIBUTES = [\n  'mat-button',\n  'mat-flat-button',\n  'mat-icon-button',\n  'mat-raised-button',\n  'mat-stroked-button',\n  'mat-mini-fab',\n  'mat-fab',\n];\n\n// Boilerplate for applying mixins to MatButton.\n/** @docs-private */\nexport class MatButtonBase {\n  constructor(public _elementRef: ElementRef) {}\n}\n\nexport const _MatButtonMixinBase:\n    CanDisableRippleCtor & CanDisableCtor & CanColorCtor & typeof MatButtonBase =\n        mixinColor(mixinDisabled(mixinDisableRipple(MatButtonBase)));\n\n/**\n * Material design button.\n */\n@Component({\n  moduleId: module.id,\n  selector: `button[mat-button], button[mat-raised-button], button[mat-icon-button],\n             button[mat-fab], button[mat-mini-fab], button[mat-stroked-button],\n             button[mat-flat-button]`,\n  exportAs: 'matButton',\n  host: {\n    '[disabled]': 'disabled || null',\n    '[class._mat-animation-noopable]': '_animationMode === \"NoopAnimations\"',\n  },\n  templateUrl: 'button.html',\n  styleUrls: ['button.scss'],\n  inputs: ['disabled', 'disableRipple', 'color'],\n  encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None,\n  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush,\n})\nexport class MatButton extends _MatButtonMixinBase\n    implements OnDestroy, CanDisable, CanColor, CanDisableRipple {\n\n  /** Whether the button is round. */\n  readonly isRoundButton: boolean = this._hasHostAttributes('mat-fab', 'mat-mini-fab');\n\n  /** Whether the button is icon button. */\n  readonly isIconButton: boolean = this._hasHostAttributes('mat-icon-button');\n\n  /** Reference to the MatRipple instance of the button. */\n  @ViewChild(MatRipple) ripple: MatRipple;\n\n  constructor(elementRef: ElementRef,\n              /**\n               * @deprecated Platform checks for SSR are no longer needed\n               * @breaking-change 8.0.0\n               */\n              _platform: Platform,\n              private _focusMonitor: FocusMonitor,\n              // @breaking-change 8.0.0 `_animationMode` parameter to be made required.\n              @Optional() @Inject(ANIMATION_MODULE_TYPE) public _animationMode?: string) {\n    super(elementRef);\n\n    // For each of the variant selectors that is prevent in the button's host\n    // attributes, add the correct corresponding class.\n    for (const attr of BUTTON_HOST_ATTRIBUTES) {\n      if (this._hasHostAttributes(attr)) {\n        (elementRef.nativeElement as HTMLElement).classList.add(attr);\n      }\n    }\n\n    this._focusMonitor.monitor(this._elementRef, true);\n\n    if (this.isRoundButton) {\n      this.color = DEFAULT_ROUND_BUTTON_COLOR;\n    }\n  }\n\n  ngOnDestroy() {\n    this._focusMonitor.stopMonitoring(this._elementRef);\n  }\n\n  /** Focuses the button. */\n  focus(): void {\n    this._getHostElement().focus();\n  }\n\n  _getHostElement() {\n    return this._elementRef.nativeElement;\n  }\n\n  _isRippleDisabled() {\n    return this.disableRipple || this.disabled;\n  }\n\n  /** Gets whether the button has one of the given attributes. */\n  _hasHostAttributes(...attributes: string[]) {\n    return attributes.some(attribute => this._getHostElement().hasAttribute(attribute));\n  }\n}\n\n/**\n * Raised Material design button.\n */\n@Component({\n  moduleId: module.id,\n  selector: `a[mat-button], a[mat-raised-button], a[mat-icon-button], a[mat-fab],\n             a[mat-mini-fab], a[mat-stroked-button], a[mat-flat-button]`,\n  exportAs: 'matButton, matAnchor',\n  host: {\n    // Note that we ignore the user-specified tabindex when it's disabled for\n    // consistency with the `mat-button` applied on native buttons where even\n    // though they have an index, they're not tabbable.\n    '[attr.tabindex]': 'disabled ?

A  element should be used whenever some action\nis performed. An  element should be used whenever the user will navigate to another view.\nThere are several button variants, each applied as an attribute:\n\n\n\nAttribute\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nmat-button\nRectangular text button w/ no elevation\n\n\nmat-raised-button\nRectangular contained button w/ elevation\n\n\nmat-flat-button\nRectangular contained button w/ no elevation\n\n\nmat-stroked-button\nRectangular outlined button w/ no elevation\n\n\nmat-icon-button\nCircular button with a transparent background, meant to contain an icon\n\n\nmat-fab\nCircular button w/ elevation, defaults to theme's accent color\n\n\nmat-mini-fab\nSame as mat-fab but smaller\n\n\n\nTheming\nButtons can be colored in terms of the current theme using the color property to set the\nbackground color to primary, accent, or warn.\nCapitalization\nAccording to the Material design spec button text has to be capitalized, however we have opted not\nto capitalize buttons automatically via text-transform: uppercase, because it can cause issues in\ncertain locales. It is also worth noting that using ALL CAPS in the text itself causes issues for\nscreen-readers, which will read the text character-by-character. We leave the decision of how to\napproach this to the consuming app.\nAccessibility\nAngular Material uses native  and  elements to ensure an accessible experience by\ndefault. The  element should be used for any interaction that performs an action on the\ncurrent page. The  element should be used for any interaction that navigates to another\nview.\nButtons or links containing only icons (such as mat-fab, mat-mini-fab, and mat-icon-button)\nshould be given a meaningful label via aria-label or aria-labelledby.\n\n    \n\n    \n        import {FocusMonitor} from '@angular/cdk/a11y';\nimport {Platform} from '@angular/cdk/platform';\nimport {\n
